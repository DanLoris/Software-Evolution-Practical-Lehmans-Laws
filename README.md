# Software Evolution Practical Session: Lehman's laws

This repository contains the Python Jupyter Notebook for the Software Evolution practical session.

## Overview

The purpose of this practical session is to familiarize ourselves with Lehman's laws of software evolution and verify them using code counting methods and tools. We will be working with a large open-source software project, Eucalyptus, and use tools like CLOC for code analysis.

## Contents

- `LawsSoftEvol_CodeCounting.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter Notebook for the practical session. It contains all the code, explanations, and analyses required for the assignment.
- `data/`: This directory contains any data files or resources used in the notebook.

## Instructions

To run the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:
1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already (`pip install notebook`).
3. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
4. Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal to start the Jupyter Notebook server.
5. Open the `LawsSoftEvol_CodeCounting.ipynb` file in your browser.
6. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the practical session.
