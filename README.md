# Software Evolution Practical Session: Lehman's laws

## Overview

This repository contains the Python Jupyter Notebook for the Software Evolution practical session. The purpose of this practical session is to familiarize ourselves with Lehman's laws of software evolution and verify them using code counting methods and tools. We will be working with a large open-source software project, Eucalyptus, and use tools like CLOC for code analysis.

## Contents

- `LawsSoftEvol_CodeCounting.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter Notebook for the practical session. It contains all the code, explanations, and analyses required for the assignment.
- `data/`: This directory contains any data files or resources used in the notebook.

## Instructions

To run the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already (`pip install notebook`).
3. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
4. Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal to start the Jupyter Notebook server.
5. Open the `LawsSoftEvol_CodeCounting.ipynb` file in your browser.
6. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the practical session.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the notebook:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- scipy

You can install the dependencies using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```
